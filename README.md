# VitalBridgeAI: Autonomous LLM Agents for Continuous Patient Monitoring - A System Bridging Intensive Care and Home Healthcare

# Abstract: 
Continuous patient monitoring across intensive care and home healthcare settings faces major challenges from fragmented data and poor care transitions. We introduce VitalBridgeAI, a novel multi-agent architecture leveraging state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude 3, and LLaMA 3 for autonomous, context-aware monitoring. The system features role-based agents that collaborate using structured protocols, enabling real-time, memory-enhanced clinical decision-making with explainable reasoning pathways. Through integrated SHAP and LIME techniques, our framework offers transparency and regulatory alignment while maintaining HIPAA compliance via differential privacy. Evaluations across simulated and real-world scenarios demonstrate significant improvements in alert precision (93%), reduction of care transition gaps (87%), and clinician workflow integration. Our contribution represents a major advancement in generative AI for healthcare, with implications for personalized medicine, human-AI collaboration, and trustworthy clinical automation.

# Problem Statement:
Discontinuity in patient monitoring between ICU and home healthcare environments leads to risks such as information loss, adverse events, and poor outcomes. Traditional systems are fragmented and lack intelligent coordination, explainability, and privacy-preserving integration.

# Proposed Solution:
VitalBridgeAI - A novel multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) architecture that enables continuous, context-aware patient monitoring across care transitions (ICU to home). It features:
- Multi-agent LLM system with role-specialized agents (Vitals, Medications, Risk, etc.)
- Memory-enhanced reasoning using MemGPT
- Explainability tools (SHAP, LIME, TracIn)
- Privacy-preserving integration via differential privacy and HIPAA compliance

# Technologies Used:

- GPT-4, Claude 3, LLaMA 3, Gemini 1.5, Mistral, Mixtral
- LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGPT, LangChain
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), MemGPT
- Edge-to-cloud infrastructure (Jetson, AWS)
- Federated learning, PEFT/LoRA, RLHF

# Results:

-  +87% reduction in care transition gaps
-  Alert precision: 93% vs. 76% (baseline)
-  Diagnostic accuracy: 89% agreement with clinicians
- 92% completeness in explainability; 94% consistency
- Maintained HIPAA compliance, no vulnerabilities found
